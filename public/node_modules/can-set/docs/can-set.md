@description

can-set is a utility for comparing [can-set/Set sets] that are represented by the parameters commonly passed to service requests.

@type {Object}

Once you've imported the `can-set` module into your project, use it to create a `set.Algebra` and then use that to compare and perform operations on sets.  

```js
var set = require('can-set');
// create an algebra
var algebra = new set.Algebra(
    // specify the unique identifier on data
    set.props.id("_id"),  
    // specify that completed can be true, false or undefined
    set.props.boolean("completed"),
    // specify properties that define pagination
    set.props.rangeInclusive("start","end"),
    // specify the property that controls sorting
    set.props.sort("orderBy"),
)

// compare two sets
algebra.subset({start: 2, end: 3}, {start: 1, end: 4}) //-> true
algebra.difference({} , {completed: true}) //-> {completed: false}

// perform operations on sets
algebra.getSubset({start: 2,end: 3},{start: 1,end: 4},
            [{id: 1},{id: 2},{id: 3},{id: 4}])
//-> [{id: 2},{id: 3}]
```

## Use

A [can-set/Set] is a plain JavaScript object used to represent a
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_theory#Basic_concepts_and_notation set] of data usually sent to the server to fetch a list of records.  For example,
a list of all completed todos might be represented by:

```
{complete: true}
```

This set might be passed to [can-connect/can/map/map.getList] like:

```
Todo.getList({complete: true})
```

An [can-set.Algebra] is used to detail the behavior of these sets,
often using already provided [can-set.props] comparators:

```
var todoAlgebra = new set.Algebra(
  set.props.boolean("complete"),
  set.props.id("_id")
);
```

Using an algebra, all sorts of special behaviors can be performed. For
example, if we already loaded the incomplete todos (`{complete: false}`) and
wanted to load all todos (`{}`), we could use a set [can-set.Algebra.prototype.difference] to figure out how to load
only the data that hasn't been loaded.

```js
todoAlgebra.difference({}, {complete: false}) //-> {complete: true}
```

These algebra's are typically used internally by either [can-connect] or
[can-fixture] to provide these special behaviors:

```js
var cacheConnection = connect([
  require("can-connect/data/memory-cache/memory-cache")
],{
  algebra: todoAlgebra
});

var todoConnection = connect([
  require("can-connect/data/url/url"),
  require("can-connect/cache-requests/cache-requests")
],{
  cacheConnection: cacheConnection,
  url: "/todos",
  algebra: todoAlgebra
});
```

```js
var todoStore = fixture.store([
    { _id : 1, name : 'Do the dishes', complete: true },
    { _id : 2, name : 'Walk the dog', complete: false }
  ],
  todoAlgebra );

fixture("/todos/{_id}", todoStore);
```

The best way to think about `can-set` is that its a way to detail
the behavior of your service layer so other utilities can benefit.

## Solving Common Issues

Configuring the proper `set.Algebra` can be tricky.  The best way to make sure you
have things working is to create an algebra and make sure some of the basics
work.  

The most common problem is that your `algebra` isn't configured to know what
instance data belongs in which set.  

For example, `{id: 1, name: "do dishes"}` should belong to the
set `{sort: "name asc"}`, but it doesn't:

```js
var algebra = new set.Algebra();
algebra.has({sort: "name asc"}, {id: 1, name: "do dishes"}) //-> false
```

The fix is to either ignore `sort` like:

```js
var algebra = new set.Algebra({
    sort: function() { return true; }
});
algebra.has({sort: "name asc"}, {id: 1, name: "do dishes"}) //-> false
```

Or even better, make `sort` actually able to understand sorting:

```js
var algebra = new set.Algebra(
    set.props.sort("sort")
);
algebra.has({sort: "name asc"}, {id: 1, name: "do dishes"}) //-> true
```

Similarly, you can verify that [can-set.Algebra.prototype.getSubset]
works.  The following, with a default algebra gives
the wrong results:

```js
var algebra = new set.Algebra();
algebra.getSubset(
    {offset: 1, limit: 2},
    {},
    [
        {id: 1, name: "do dishes"}
        {id: 2, name: "mow lawn"},
        {id: 3, name: "trash"}]) //-> []
```

This is because it's looking for instance data where `offset===1` and `limit===2`.
Again, you can teach your algebra what to do with these properties like:

```js
var algebra = new set.Algebra(
    set.props.offsetLimit("offset","limit")
);
algebra.getSubset(
    {offset: 1, limit: 2},
    {},
    [
        {id: 1, name: "do dishes"}
        {id: 2, name: "mow lawn"},
        {id: 3, name: "trash"}]) //-> [
            //  {id: 2, name: "mow lawn"},
            // {id: 3, name: "trash"}
            // ]
```
