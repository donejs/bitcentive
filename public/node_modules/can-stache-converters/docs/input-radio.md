Cross bind a value to a radio input.

## Binding to radios

To bind to a radio input, if you have a set of boolean values you can bind to the input’s `checked` property as you do with [can-stache-converters.pages.input-checkbox].

```handlebars
<input type="radio" {($checked)}="one" /> One
<input type="radio" {($checked)}="two" /> Two
```

```js
var template = stache.from("demo");
var map = new DefineMap({
	one: true,
	two: false
});

document.body.appendChild(template(map));
```

## Binding to a selected value

More often than binding to boolean values of each radio's `checked` value, you will want to know what the `value` is of the radio group. Since each radio has its own `value`, the radio's selected value is the value of the radio item that is selected.

Using the [can-stache-converters.equal] [can-stache.registerConverter converter] you can bind a value within your scope to the radio group’s selected value:
