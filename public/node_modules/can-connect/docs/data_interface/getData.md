@typedef {function} can-connect/connection.getData getData
@parent can-connect/DataInterface
@description Retrieves a record.

@option {function}

  Returns a promise that resolves to the instance data for particular parameters.

  The following shows how [can-connect/constructor/constructor] calls `getData`
  and what it does with the response:

  ```js
  connection.getData({id: 1}).then(function(instanceData){
  	connection.hydrateInstance(instanceData);
  });
  ```

  @param {Object} params A object that represents the set of data needed to be loaded.

  @return {Promise<Object>} A promise that resolves to the properties of a record.

@body

## Use

Extensions like [can-connect/data/url/url] implement `getData`  but implementing it yourself can be as simple as:

```js
var behavior = connect([],{
  getData: function(params){
    return new Promise(function(resolve, reject){
		$.get("/api/todo",params).then(resolve, reject)
	});
  }
})
```
