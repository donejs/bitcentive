@typedef {function} can-connect/connection.getSets getSets
@parent can-connect/DataInterface

@description Gets the sets that are available in the connection.

@option {function}

  Returns a promise that resolves to a list of [can-set/Set] objects contained in the
  connection.  This is useful for querying a [can-connect/base/base.cacheConnection]
  if it will be able to satisfy a request.

  An example response might look like:

  ```js
  connection.getSets().then(function(sets){
	  sets //-> [
	  //   {complete: true},
	  //   {userId: 5, start: 10, end: 20}
	  //]
  })
  ```

  @return {Promise<Array<can-set/Set>>} A promise that resolves to an an array of sets.
