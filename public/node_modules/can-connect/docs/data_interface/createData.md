@typedef {function} can-connect/connection.createData createData
@parent can-connect/DataInterface

@description Creates a new record in the connection.

@option {function}

Creates a new record given the serialized form of the data. Resolves to a promise with any additional
properties that should be added to the
instance. A [can-util/js/cid/cid client ID] is passed of the instance that is
being created.

The following shows how [can-connect/constructor/constructor] calls `createData`
and what it does with the response:

```js
var CID = require("can-util/js/cid/cid");

// Create an instance of a special type
var myInstance = new MyType({ ... });

// get its CID
var cid = CID(myInstance);

// get its raw data
var instanceData = connection.serializeInstance(myInstance);

connection.createData(instanceData, cid).then(function(createdInstanceData){
	connection.createdInstance(myInstance, createdInstanceData);
})
```


  @param {Object} instanceData The serialized data of the instance.

  @param {Number} [cid] A unique id that represents the instance that is being created.  Given this value,
  the instance can be retrieved in the [can-connect/constructor/constructor.cidStore].

  @return {Promise<Object>} A promise resolved with the _created_ data of the newly created instance. The _created_
  data __must__ have the [can-connect/base/base.id] of the created record.  

  By default, [can-connect/constructor/constructor.createdInstance] only adds the data in `createdInstanceData` to
  `myInstance`, it does not remove it.  To remove "missing" properties on `myInstance` that are not in `createdInstanceData`, overwrite
  [can-connect/constructor/constructor.createdInstance].
