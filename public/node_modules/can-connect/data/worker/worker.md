Connects a connection to another connection in a worker thread.

@signature `dataWorker( baseConnection )`

If a [Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers)
is provided, overwrites the "data interface methods" to package the arguments and send them as
part of a `postMessage` to the Worker.


If a `Worker` is not provided, it is assumed "data-worker" is being added
within a worker thread.  It listens to messages sent to the Worker, calls the specified "data interface method"
and sends a message back with the result.

Any data methods called on the `window` connection will wait until the `worker` connection
has established a handshake.

## Use

The best way to use `data/worker` is to create a connection module that works when loaded in
either the `window` or in a [Worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers).
This pattern tends to work even if workers are not supported.

The following creates a connection that does the work of [can-connect/cache-requests/cache-requests],
[can-connect/data/url/url], and [can-connect/data/memory-cache/memory-cache] in a worker thread.  

@demo demos/can-connect/data-worker.html

The `todo_connection` module can be found [here](https://github.com/canjs/can-connect/blob/master/src/data/worker/demo/todo_connection.js)
and looks like the following:


```js
var connect = require("can-connect");
var fixture = require("can-fixture");

// If we are in the main thread, see if we can load this same
// connection in a worker thread.
var worker;
if(typeof document !== "undefined") {
	worker = new Worker( System.stealURL+"?main=can-connect/data/worker/demo/todo_connection" );
}


// create cache connection
var cache = connect([
	require("can-connect/data/memory-cache/")
],{
	name: "todos"
});

// Create the main connection with everything you need.  If there is a worker,
// all data interface methods will be sent to the worker.
var todosConnection = connect([
	require("can-connect/data/url/url"),
	require("can-connect/cache-requests/cache-requests"),
	require("can-connect/data/worker/worker"),
	require("can-connect/constructor/constructor"),
	require("can-connect/constructor/store/store")
],{
    url: "/todos",
    cacheConnection: cache,
    worker: worker,
    name: "todos"
});


fixture.delay = 1000;
fixture({
	"GET /todos": function(request){
		return {data: [
			{id: 1, name: "wash dishes"},
			{id: 2, name: "mow lawn"},
			{id: 3, name: "do laundry"}
		]};
	}
});

module.exports = todosConnection;
```



The things to notice:

1. A `Worker` should be passed as the [can-connect/data/worker/worker.worker] option
that loads a connection with the same name as the connection in the `window`.  In thise case, the same
connection module is loaded so everything works.

2. A single `Worker` could load multiple connection modules and perform other behaviors.  

### Split Connection Logic

THe previous example used a single module that was loaded by both the window and the worker.
This doesn't have to be the case.  Two different modules could be used.  For example, `todo-window.js` and
`todo-worker.js`.  Each might look like:

```js
// todo-window.js
var workerURL = System.stealURL+"?main=app/models/todo-worker";

var todoConnection = connect([
	require("can-connect/data/worker/worker"),
	require("can-connect/constructor/constructor"),
	require("can-connect/constructor/store/store"),
  {
    worker: new Worker( workerURL ),
    name: "todos"
  });
```

```js
// todo-worker.js
var cache = connect([
	require("can-connect/data/memory-cache/memory-cache")
],{
	name: "todos-cache"
});

var todoConnection = connect([
	require("can-connect/data/url/url"),
	require("can-connect/cache-requests/cache-requests"),
	require("can-connect/data/worker/worker")
],{
    url: "/todos",
    cacheConnection: cache,
    name: "todos"
  });
```

However, the problem with the two-module approach is that it will not work
if Workers are not supported by your browser.
