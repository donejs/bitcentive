@description
A ZoneSpec is the way you tap into the lifecycle hooks of a [can-zone Zone]. The hooks are described below.

Using these hooks you can do things like create timers and override global variables that will change the *shape* of code that runs within the Zone.

	@option {function} created

	Called when the zone is first created, after all ZoneSpecs have been parsed. this is useful if you need to do setup behavior that covers the entire zone lifecycle.

	```js
	new Zone({
		created: function(){
			// Called as soon as `new Zone` is called
		}
	});
	```

	@option {function} beforeRun

	Called immediately before the **Zone.prototype.run** function is called.

	```js
	var zone = new Zone({
		beforeRun: function(){
			// Setup that needs to happen immediately before running
			// the zone function
		}
	});

	zone.run(function() { ... });
	```

	@option {function()} beforeTask

	Called before each Task is called. Use this to override any globals you want to exist during the execution of the task:

	```js
	new Zone({
		beforeTask: function(){
			window.setTimeout = mySpecialSetTimeout;
		}
	});
	```

	@option {function} ended

	Called when the Zone has ended and is about to exit (it's Promise will resolve).

	@option {Array<string>} hooks

	**hooks** allows you to specify custom hooks that your plugin calls. This is mostly to communicate between plugins that inherit each other.

	```js
	var barZone = {
		created: function(){
			this.execHook("beforeBar");
		},

		hooks: ["beforeBar"]
	};

	var fooZone = {
		beforeBar: function(){
			// Called!
		},
		plugins: [barZone]
	};

	new Zone({
		plugins: [fooZone]
	});

	zone.run(function() { ... });
	```

	@option {Array<can-zone.ZoneSpec|can-zone.makeZoneSpec>} plugins

	Allows specifying nested [can-zone.ZoneSpec ZoneSpecs] that the current depends on. This allows creating rich plugins that depend on other plugins (ZoneSpecs). You can imagine having a bunch of tiny plugins that do one thing and then composing them together into one meta-plugin that is more end-user friendly.

	Similar to the [can-zone Zone] constructor you can either specify [can-zone.ZoneSpec] objects or functions that return ZoneSpec objects. The former gives you a closure specific to the Zone, which is often needed for variables. These two forms are equivalent:

	```js
	var specOne = {
		created: function(){

		}
	};

	var specTwo = function(){
		return {
			created: function(){

			}
		}
	};

	var zone = new Zone({
		plugins: [ specOne, specTwo ]
	});
	```
